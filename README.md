To start the calculator: run this file with a local python interpreter

Current major limitations:<br>
| Inferno drop chances might be unaccurate<br>
| Item prices from AH (like pets and Everburning Flame) have to be updated manually<br>
| Unconfirmed average wool amount from Enchanted Shears<br>
| For offline calculations of mob minions: Hypixel takes 5 actions to spawn in mobs, this calculator does not account for that<br>
| Not entirely bazaar manipulation proof<br>
| Coop Shenanigans is not an actual option (but can still be applied by using the effective wisdom)<br>
| Player Harvests interacting with minion upgrades is going wrong in every way<br>
| Good Storage logic is just not there<br>
| Cooldown upgrade logic is using the wrong cooldowns<br>
Lesser limitations are listed on the support discord server,<br>
the invite to that server is at the bottom of https://herodirk.github.io/
